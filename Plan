Plan for hw3

Purpose:

The purpose of sttyl is to create a version of Unix's stty program. As compared
to stty, my sttyl version includes the following differing qualities (which may
not be exhaustive):

    [1] it only works for a subset of settings, i.e, erase, kill, intr, icrnl,
        hupcl, echo, echoe, opost, icanon, and isig
    [2] it does not accept any option arguments, e.g., [-a]
    [3] it cannot change an attribute's character setting to two-char           
        combinations such as those of control characters; only single chars can
        be handled for this
